## Abstract
Electronic health record (EHR) is an inherently multimodal register of the patients' health status characterized by static data and multivariate time series (MTS). While MTS are a valuable tool for clinical prediction, their fusion with other data modalities can possibly result in more thorough insights and more accurate results.  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as fundamental tools for identifying and defining the underlying patterns in the healthcare domain.  However, fundamental improvements in interpretability are needed for DNN models to be widely used in the clinical setting.  In this study, we present an approach built on a collection of interpretable multimodal data-driven models that may anticipate and understand the emergence of antimicrobial multidrug resistance (AMR) germs in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada (Madrid, Spain). The profile and initial health status of the patient are modeled using static variables, while the evolution of the patient’s health status  during the ICU stay is modeled using several MTS, including mechanical ventilation and antibiotics intake. The multimodal DNNs models proposed in this paper include interpretable principles in addition to being effective at predicting AMR and providing an explainable prediction support system for AMR in the ICU. Furthermore, our proposed methodology based on multimodal models and interpretatibility schemes can be leveraged in additional clinical problems dealing with EHR data, broadening the impact and applicability of our results.

## Code Organization

This repository contains the source code for the different architectures used in the presented paper to facilitate ease of understanding and usage. It includes the implementation of various DNN models, each detailed in separate files with annotations. For realistic simulations, scripts are provided to generate synthetic data resembling EHR inputs, encompassing both static variables and MTSs. The repository also contains complete training and evaluation scripts, guiding users from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. A significant part of the code is dedicated to the interpretability frameworks of our DNN models, enhancing their transparency and clinical applicability. Supporting the core components are various utility functions and scripts for model development and experimentation. Comprehensive documentation and example use cases are provided to assist in practical applications. Lastly, the repository includes tools for analyzing experimental results, such as visualization and statistical analysis scripts, facilitating a deeper understanding and interpretation of the outcomes. This organized approach aims to ensure replicability and ease of use for researchers and practitioners in the field.
